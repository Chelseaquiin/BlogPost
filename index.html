            <h2>Understanding C# Assemblies</h1>
            <p>If you have built a few C# projects on Visual Studio and you are still confused about what an assembly is, this
                article
                will help clarify it.
            
                According to Microsoft, “An assembly is a collection of types and resources that are built to work together and form
                a
                logical unit of functionality.”
            
                No. Don’t panic. I am not about to confuse you any further. This article aims to break it down for you using your
                knowledge of Visual studio. Follow me closely, please.

            <h2>Main Content</h2>
            <p>When you create a new Console application project on your Visual Studio IDE, that’s an assembly. An executable
                assembly
                (.exe). A new Console application project has the dependencies file and the program.cs file. You can add new classes
                to
                your console app project. All of them are still inside one assembly.</p>
                <img class="images" src="/Images/a1.webp" alt="Cars being assembled">
            
                <p>Every console application produces the .exe file extension. There’s another type of file extension. It’s the .dll
                file
                extension. DLL stands for Dynamic-Link Library.</p>
            
                <p>How do we generate the .dll file extension? This file extension is generated when creating a new Class Library
                project.
                Class Library projects are different from Console App projects in the sense that console app projects are executable
                projects while class library projects aren’t.</p>
            
                <p>So, what does it mean for a project to be an executable project? It simply means that you can run the project, from
                its
                entry point, which is usually the Program.cs file in an executable project. Class libraries do not have an entry
                point.</p>
                <img class="images" src="/Images/a2.webp" alt="Cars being assembled">

                <p>In the picture above, I added a class library to my Solutions project. And unlike its console app counterpart, the class
                library has no entry point. No program.cs file, where one can run their code. It’s just a collection of classes. You
                can’t run a simple Console.WriteLine(“Hello World”); and it would run.</p>
                
                <p>You might be wondering what the need for class libraries is. According to Microsoft, “Class libraries are the shared
                library concept for .NET. They enable you to componentize useful functionality into modules that can be used by multiple
                applications.”</p>
                
                <p>In simple terms, class libraries help you group your work into useful and similar functionalities.
                
                You can have a class library that has different folders — one for domains and another one for enums. So, for every enum
                that you create, you can move it to the enums folder. The same goes for the domain. It’s there to make your work
                cleaner.</p>
                
                <p>Now, what happens after you have written a code and you want to check if indeed the code runs? How do you handle that?
                
                I have two projects under my ConsoleApp2 solution. Two different projects/assemblies. One is a Console application and
                the other one is a class library. The console application is always there for you to test if what you have built is
                working and this is possible because it has an entry point.</p>
                
                <p>To be able to test your class library code in your console application project, you have to first reference the class
                library project in your console application project. This can be done by right-clicking on the dependencies in the
                console application project. You will see an option to add a project reference. Click on it. Then you will see a list of
                possible projects that you can reference. Click on the one you want and press okay.</p>
                <img class="images" src="/Images/a3.webp" alt="Cars being assembled">

                <p>We only have one project file here because we created just two projects. If we are building a complex application where
                we needed more than two projects, you are going to see all of them listed. So, you will click on the one(s) that you
                want to add as a reference.</p>
                
                <p>After doing this, you can go ahead and import a namespace. This is done by doing, “using [the namespace of the project
                you just added as a reference];”
                
                After doing all of this, you can now easily create an instance of the class you referenced.</p>
