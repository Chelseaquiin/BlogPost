    <h1>About-Me</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    Hi everyone, my name is Uzoamaka Nweze, and I am a software developer. I began with backend development and I'm now
    diving into frontend development.</p>

    <h2>Expectations from the Upskill '24 program</h2>
    
    <p>My expectation for this program is to gain an understanding of frontend development and to feel confident enough to work
    on projects.
    
    Thank you</p>
